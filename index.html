            <span id="intro-para-bold">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown, fuzzy,
                and found in the produce
                section of your local supermarket.</span> But the kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native
            to eastern
            Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in
            New
            Zealand.

                <p class="desc-para">The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep
                    and wet, surrounded by
                    shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to
                    nest,
                    rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy
                    forest
                    or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows within its territory, using strong toes
                    and
                    claws. Nest burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at the entrance to provide
                    great
                    camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay her eggs.</p>

                            src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/307493/flock-of-birds-fly-free-birds.svg" alt=""></span>
                    &nbsp; Family Life</h2>
                <p class="desc-para">
                    Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr during
                    mating. Pairs do fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for
                    his company. If another kiwi invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been
                    known to fight to the death, although this is rare.
                <p class="desc-para">
                    An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a more
                    desirable one wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a
                    female. Instead, he follows one around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, the
                    female might wander off or try to scare him away.
                    Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground
                    burrows dug by the male.

                </p>
                <p class="desc-para">
                    The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale
                    green in color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20 percent
                    of her weight; that would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound
                    (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the female kiwi
                    should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms) rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to
                    3.6 kilograms).
