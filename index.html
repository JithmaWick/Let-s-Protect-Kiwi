            <span id="intro-para-bold">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown, fuzzy, and found in the produce
                section of your local supermarket.</span> But the kiwi is not a fruitâ€”that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern
            Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in New
            Zealand.
